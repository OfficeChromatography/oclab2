# OCLab2
## Next Generation Office Chromatography

![OCLab2](OCLab2.png)

The former [OCLab prototype](https://github.com/OfficeChromatography/OCLab) of a “miniaturized all-in-one open
 source system for planar chromatography” was upgraded by an HPTLC plate visualizing cabinet to protect the 
 plate from extraneous light during capturing of images, including RGBW, UV 278 nm and UV 366 nm LED boards 
 as well as a Raspberry Pi V2 camera module. 
 
 Additionally, a newly designed printhead was manufactured, 
 controlled by a self-constructed ink-jet board allowing to check the nozzles’ resistance heating circuit. 
 Furthermore, plate heating was enabled, especially favorable when higher volumes of aqueous samples are to 
 be applied. 
 
 The former [OC Manager software](https://github.com/OfficeChromatography/OC_manager) was completely 
 restructured and newly written in R to speed-up the processes ([OC_manager2](https://github.com/OfficeChromatography/oc_manager2))
 , also supported by the new Raspberry Pi 4B computer with 4 GB RAM .


### Hardware/Firmware
The 3D printed parts are in the folder 'Construction Set', the electronic boards are described in the folder 
'Eagle Files', and the modified firmware is available in the folder 'Marlin'.
